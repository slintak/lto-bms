\section{Detailed Description}

Lithium Titanate Oxide (LTO) batteries are a distinct category within the rechargeable lithium-based battery family, utilizing lithium titanate (\ce{Li4Ti5O12}) as the anode material. This composition gives LTO cells unique characteristics that differentiate them from other lithium-ion chemistries, such as Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion), Lithium Polymer (Li-Po), and Lithium Iron Phosphate (\ce{LiFePO4}, or LFP) batteries.

LTO batteries present a compelling option for applications requiring long cycle life, operation in extreme temperatures, and rapid charging. However, their lower energy density and higher cost may limit their suitability for applications where space and budget are primary concerns.

An LTO cell typically operates within the voltage ranges shown in Table~\ref{tab:lto-comparison}. These voltage ranges are lower compared to other lithium-based batteries, necessitating appropriate system design considerations when integrating LTO cells into the intended application. They are not and cannot be a drop-in replacement for Li-Ion, Li-Po and other types of batteries and cannot be charged by their charging ICs.

With the parameters in Table~\ref{tab:lto-comparison}, one can see that LTO batteries are a great fit for battery-powered, low-power devices installed outdoors year-round.

\begin{table}[ht]

\end{table}

\subsection{Advantages of LTO Cells}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Extended Cycle Life:} They can endure a significantly higher number of charge-discharge cycles, often exceeding 4000 cycles, which is substantially more than typical Li-Ion or \ce{LiFePO4} batteries.
\item \textbf{Enhanced Safety:} The structural stability of LTO reduces risks associated with thermal runaway, making them safer under various operating conditions.
\item \textbf{Wide Operating Temperature Range:} LTO batteries perform reliably in a broad temperature spectrum, including sub-zero conditions, making them suitable for extreme environments.
\item \textbf{Rapid Charging:} LTO cells support high charge and discharge rates, allowing for quick charging times. This is less important for IoT and low-power devices which this LTO battery pack with BMS is designed for.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disadvantages of LTO Cells}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lower Energy Density:} They typically offer energy densities between 30–110 Wh/kg, which is lower than that of Li-Ion and LiFePO$_4$ batteries.
\item \textbf{Higher Cost:} The advanced materials and manufacturing processes contribute to a higher price point compared to other lithium-ion batteries.
\end{itemize}

\section{Protection Features}

The Battery Management System (BMS) includes essential protection mechanisms to ensure safe and reliable operation of Lithium Titanate Oxide (LTO) cells. These mechanisms protect against overvoltage (OVLO), undervoltage (UVLO), and overcurrent (OC) conditions. All protection thresholds are fully configurable by writing new values into the EEPROM memory of the BMS's main microcontroller, an \texttt{ATtiny824}.

\textbf{Overvoltage protection} ensures that the cell voltage does not exceed a safe upper limit. When the measured voltage on the LTO cells rises above the configured cutoff threshold (\texttt{ovlo\_cutoff}), the BMS disconnects the charging path. Charging is only re-enabled once the voltage falls below the defined release level (\texttt{ovlo\_release}). This protects the cell from overcharging, which could otherwise reduce its lifespan or cause safety hazards.

To prevent \textbf{over-discharge} and possible damage to the LTO cells, the BMS continuously monitors the voltage level of the cells and disconnects the load if the voltage drops below the cutoff threshold (\texttt{uvlo\_cutoff}). The load remains disconnected until the voltage recovers above the release threshold (\texttt{uvlo\_release}). This functionality helps preserve battery health and avoids deep discharge scenarios.

The BMS also includes \textbf{overcurrent protection} on the output. If the current exceeds the \texttt{max\_current} setting (in mA), the output is disabled. The duration of the overcurrent condition is monitored, and if it persists longer than the configured timeout (\texttt{oclo\_timeout}, in milliseconds), the output is turned off to prevent overheating or damage to connected circuitry.

All protection parameters can be configured by the user via a Python tool included in the firmware repository. This tool allows writing new settings into the EEPROM of the \texttt{ATtiny824} via UPDI programming interface, enabling customization for different applications, usage scenarios, or safety requirements. Their default parameters are in Table~\ref{tab:bms-protection-config}.

\section{I\textsuperscript{2}C Interface}

The battery management system (BMS) features an I\textsuperscript{2}C
interface for communication with external devices such as the Meshtastic
firmware. This allows the user to read power, current, and voltage
information from the battery without requiring any firmware modification
on the Meshtastic side, as it already supports the INA260.

This interface supports standard modes of communication and adheres
to the INA260 register structure, ensuring compatibility with
Meshtastic firmware and ease of integration into existing systems.

The I\textsuperscript{2}C interface of the BMS mimics the INA260's
register set. The communication protocol and register mapping are
identical to that of the INA260. Table~\ref{tab:register-set}
is a summary of the available registers.

\begin{table}[!ht]

\begin{tablenotes}

\item[2]{This register is present only for the compatibility with INA260 and is ignored by the current firmware.}
\item[3]{These registers and their values are the same as those of the INA260 to mimic the interface.}
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

\section{Calculating Returned Values}

The least significant bit (LSB) sizes for the \textit{Bus Voltage Register},
\textit{Current Register}, and \textit{Power Register} are fixed, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:register_calculations}. To calculate any of the values
for current, voltage, or power, take the integer value returned by
the device and multiply that value by the corresponding LSB size.

For example, the LSB for the bus voltage is 1.25 mV/bit. If the device
returns an integer value of 9584 (0x2570), the value of the battery voltage
is calculated as:

\[
V_{battery} = 1.25\ \text{mV} \times 9584 = 11.98\ \text{V}.
\]

Since the system supports current measurements in both directions,
the returned value for negative currents (battery charging, current
flowing into the LTO battery) is represented in two's complement
format. The returned power values will always be positive, even
when the current is negative.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Calculating Current, Voltage, and Power}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
\thickhline
\textbf{Register Name} & \textbf{Address} & \textbf{LSB} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textbf{Example}} & \textbf{Note} \\
\cline{4-5}
& & & \textbf{Integer Value} & \textbf{Result} & \\ 
\thickhline
Current Register & 0x01 & 1.25 mA & 0x02F8 & 0.95 A & \\
Voltage Register & 0x02 & 1.25 mV & 0x0898 & 2.75 V & \\
Power Register & 0x03 & 1.25 mW & 0x082A & 2.6125 W & \\
\thickhline
\end{tabularx}
\label{tab:register_calculations}
\end{table}

This table summarizes the calculation of the returned values for
current, voltage, and power. When working with the returned data,
it is important to multiply the raw register value by the
appropriate LSB size to obtain the correct measurement in either
volts, milliamps, or milliwatts.

\section{Self-Consumption}

The Figure~\ref{fig:self-consumption} shows the approximate power consumption of
the BMS circuit at different battery voltages. These measurements
are indicative and will likely change as the firmware is further
optimized. There are still many areas in the code that can be optimized.

        \label{fig:lto-voltage}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Based on a typical cell voltage (see Figure~\ref{fig:lto-voltage}), we know that
the LTO battery maintains a voltage of around 2.45 V during low discharge
currents, and this voltage is sustained for most of the discharge cycle. The
voltage starts to drop significantly only when the battery is nearly fully
discharged. Therefore, we can estimate the average power consumption of the BMS
circuit to be 67.45 \textmu{}Ah. If a single 1300 mAh cell is connected to the
BMS without load, it will discharge in approximately 19,000 hours, or roughly 2
years.
